# LAB | React WikiCountries

## Introduction

After spending too much time on GitHub, you found a [JSON dataset of countries](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/all) and you decided to use it to create your Wikipedia of countries!

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/labs/lab-wiki-countries-1.gif" alt="Example - Finished LAB" />
</p>

## Setup

- Fork this repo

- Clone this repo

- Open the LAB and start:

  ```bash
  $ cd lab-wiki-countries
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```


## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.


## Getting Started

Clean the `App.js` component so that it has the following structure:

```jsx
// src/App.js
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return <div className="App"></div>;
}
export default App;
```

## Instructions

### Iteration 0 | React Router installation

Remember to install the React Router:

```shell
$ npm install react-router-dom
```

And setup the router in your `src/index.js` file:

```jsx
// src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// comment skipped to stay organized
reportWebVitals();
```

### Bootstrap installation

We will use [Bootstrap V4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the design :+1:

```sh
$ npm install bootstrap
```

To make the Bootstrap styles available in the entire app, import the stylesheet in `index.js`:

```javascript
// src/index.js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

## Instructions

### Iteration 1.1 | Create components

In this iteration, we will focus on the general layout. Before you start, inside the `src` folder, create the `components` folder. There you will create at least 3 components:

- `Navbar`: Displaying the basic navbar with the LAB name

- `CountriesList`: Displays the list of links with the country names. Each link should be a `react-router-dom` `Link` which we will use to <u>send</u> the country code (`alpha3Code`) via the URL.

- `CountryDetails`: Is the component that we will render via the `react-router-dom`'s `Route` and will be <u>receiving</u> the country code (`alpha3Code`) via the URL.

  This is actually the id of the country (example: `/ESP` for Spain, `/FRA` for France).

To help you with the structure of the components, we gave you an example of a page inside `example.html`.

If you want to style it, refresh your memory on Bootstrap in the [docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0) or check out how we approached styling in the `example.html`.

### Iteration 1.2 | Navbar component

The simplest way to define a component in React is to write a JavaScript function aka function component. The navbar should be displaying the title of the LAB - WikiCountries.

### Iteration 1.3 | CountriesList component

This component should render a list of `Link`s that are used to trigger the browser URL change. Click on a `Link` component will then activate the corresponding `Route` showing the country details component.

### Iteration 1.4 | CountryDetails component and `Route` setup

Now that our list of countries is ready, we should create the `CountryDetails` component. `CountryDetails` displays the country details as per the link that we clicked. This component should be dynamically displayed/rendered with the `<Route />` using the `render` prop:

```jsx
// Example
<Route render={(props) => <SomeComponent {...props} otherProp={someData} > } />
```

You should create only 1 `<Route />` for the `CountryDetails` component.

Components rendered by the `Route` receive special `props` (`match`, `location` and `history`) passed by the `react-router-dom`. We can use this props to obtain the information coming from the browser's URL bar, for example, the `alpha3Code` code of the country. For a reminder on how to set up and access the URL parameters with React Router check [this example](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/route-props).

**NOTE:** For the small picture of the flag, you can use the `alpha2Code` and embed it in the URL as shown below:

- France: https://www.countryflags.io/FR/flat/32.png
- Germany: https://www.countryflags.io/DE/flat/32.png
- Brazil: https://www.countryflags.io/BR/flat/32.png
- etc.

### Iteration 2 | Linking it all together

Once done creating the components, the structure of elements that your `App.js` will render should look somewhat like this:

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <Navbar />

  <div className="container">
    <div className="row">
      <CountriesList countries={countries} />
      {/* React-Router Switch & the Route rendering the CountryDetails should go here */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Iteration 3 | Set the state when the component mounts

Our `App.js` application should have its own state with a state variable `countries` holding the data coming from the `countries.json` file.

The state should be set only once, after the component is initially rendered to the DOM using the `useEffect()` Hook.

### Iteration 4 | Bonus | Fetch countries data from an API

Instead of relying on the static data coming from a `json` file, let's do something more interesting and get out the data from an actual API.

Let's make a `GET` request to the URL [https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/all](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/all) and use the data returned from the response as the list of the countries. You can use either `fetch` or `axios` to make the request. You should use the `useEffect()` Hook to set an effect that runs only once and makes a request to the API.

The request should happen first thing when the application loads, therefore think about when and from where we should make the request to the API.

**Note:** The sturcture of the objects/documents returned by the RestCountries API may be different than the one you have in the `countries.json` file. This means that you may need to update your components to correctly access the values from the objects.

### Iteration 5 | Bonus | Fetch one country data from an API

Using the `useEffect` Hook set an effect in the `CountriesDetails` component. The effect should make a request to the RestCountries API and fetch the data for the specific country. You can construct the request endpoint using the country's `alpha3Code`. Example:

- United States: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/USA

- Japan: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/JPN

- India: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/IND

The effect should run after the initial render and each time the URL parameter with the `alpha3Code` changes.

Happy coding! :heart:
